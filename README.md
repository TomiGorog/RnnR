Hello there!

This is a team of 5 great junior developers' porfolio project that we worked 6 weeks at Progmatic Academy bootcamp.

This is a community-based delivery application.
Currently the runner is only recommended to use in mobile resolution (the way delivery personel would use an app in the real life) while the user interface is mostly ready in both mobile and desktop view

The web app includes CRUD functions, real-time GPS tracking integrated with Google Maps API, QR-Code based package delivery system and live package tracking with Firebase as the backend system

My responsibilities included Front-End development, UI design, coordinating a team of 5, mentoring teammates and being the Product Owner.

Metodologies: Scrum, Kanban Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, git, Firebase, Google Maps API

The web app is hosted on Vercel. Check it out:
