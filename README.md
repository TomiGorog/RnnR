Hello there!

This is a team of 5 great junior developers' porfolio project that we worked 6 weeks at Progmatic Academy bootcamp.

This is a community-based delivery application.
Currently the runner is only recommended to use in mobile resolution (the way delivery personel would use an app in the real life) while the user interface is mostly ready in both mobile and desktop view
